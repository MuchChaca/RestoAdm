# Rest Ocibon
Rest Ocibon is a simple Java application that help a restaurant owner to manage orders.

> *Note that this is not a final product, there are bugs, functionnalities not even implemented ... yet!*

## Evolution ?
The project might evolve, or just die. :scream:  
It all depends if its evolution matters for grades or not.

## Use
* The app uses ``postgresql`` and still needs to have it installed and running.
* The database used is called ``restoadm``, everything is done in the ``public`` schema.
* If you want to have a root account, for now, you need to add it from the database directly. The ``user_type`` to use is ``"a"``.
* Sample images can be found in ``src/img``
* You can have the joy to add yourself all the products you want ! :open_mouth:

## TODOs
*Subject to change*
- [ ] Update for many things (like clients, orders, products, etc)
- [ ] Improve use and selection of images
